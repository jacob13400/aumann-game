In development, nothing interesting to see here yet (probably).

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Set up Firebase:

```
Set up config file and private key as instructed.
```
Set up environments:

```bash
#Navigate to .env.example in the root folder and rename to .env and follow instructions in the file
cp .env.local.example .env.local
Enter details into the new file as required
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
